"""pySTDLM: A standard library of functionality that is commonly used in biological simulations.  Three sets of functionality exist including "StandardReactions" which include standard reactions such as Michealis-Menton, membrane transport, transporters, etc.  "StandardReactionSystems" includes published reaction systems from a variety of cells including the MinDE system, Lac switch systems in E. coli etc.  Finally, "StandardCells" includes a number of standard cell geometries."""
